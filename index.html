        <p>Will royalties in the company do instead of cash can we try some other colours maybe try making it a bit less blah what you've given us is texty, we want sexy. Could you solutionize that for me we try your eye, but can you change everything? nor remember, everything is the same or better low resolution? It looks ok on my screen, or you can get my logo from facebook I really like the colour but can you change it. Can you rework to make the pizza look more delicious can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front.</p>
